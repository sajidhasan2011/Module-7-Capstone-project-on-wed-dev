        Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of
      Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened
      wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
      ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple,
      meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a
      wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person
      who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

        Pastry refers to a variety of doughs, as well as the sweet and savoury
        baked goods made from them. These goods are often called pastries as a
        synecdoche, and the dough may be accordingly called pastry dough for
        clarity. Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery
